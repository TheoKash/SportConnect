## About The Project
SportConnect allows users to view and declare interests in sport events such as park runs or basketball games happening in near a location convenient to them. 

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]
The sport events themselves are hosted by other users who share the details of the event, including date, time, location and a description, for others to see and declare interest. \
The intention is for the events to be ad-hoc and "self governing/regulating", with a group chat QR code and link provided for participants to communicate with eachother.
